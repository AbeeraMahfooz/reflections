How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

i used FC command on Windows. it pinpoints where the actual difference between 
two files exist.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

i can easily view what differences in the code has bring about what effects
and in case of wrong changes i can resort to the old version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros:
we can decide what are the logical chamges and breakpoints in our code
cons:
programmer may forget to commit after a significant change that might be done automatically.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because it is intended for saving code files which are interconnected like html and its css file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log 
git diff id1 id2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

i know i can checkout older versions and restore to them

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

for tracking changes in my important files
